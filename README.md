Game for [Ludum Dare 38 Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/god-of-man)
Play @ [itch.io](https://pstudio.itch.io/god-of-man)

A small simulation of a small world where you as God must ensure the existence of the human race.
Technically it's just a cellular automaton with a few options for interaction.
It's more of an early prototype than an actual game and the simulation is a bit broken.
